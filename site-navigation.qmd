quarto site navigation is extremely flexible.

## dropdown on navbar

In [the quarto website](https://quarto.org/) you can see a help dropdown

      navbar:
        left:
        - text: "Help"
          menu:
            - text: "Report an Issue"
              icon: "bug"
              href: "https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues"
            - text: "Quarto Discussions"
              icon: "chat-right-text"
              href: "https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions"
            - text: "FAQ"
              icon: "question-circle"
              href: docs/faq/index.qmd

## adding separators and unnumbered sections in sidebar

## Your turn

Here are a couple sites from the quarto gallery that are great real-world examples of blending the settings together. We have seeded a couple bullets for notable elements to get you going.

The goal of this exercise will be to connect real world examples/inspiration, the quarto docs, and your ability to implement together to strengthen your mental models and seed your deeper awareness of the capabilities of quarto.

Check out a site below, study the elements and take note of some thing(s) you like. Connect that to how they implemented it, then cross reference that with additional information you can find in the quarto docs. Finally, implement it in your starter project!
